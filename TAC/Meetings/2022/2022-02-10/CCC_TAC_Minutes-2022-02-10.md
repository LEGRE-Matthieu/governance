### TAC Tech Talk - LF Mentorship

Nick Vidal (NV), Shubhra Kar, and Chaitan Shet gave an update on the LFX mentorship platform. Discussion ensued over the source of funding. Stephen Walli (SW) requested a future discussion on how LFX is being used specifically for the Enarx LFX Mentorship.

### Code of Conduct escalation

Dan Middleton (DM) and Aeva Black (AB) provided an update on Code of Conduct escalation paths. AB noted that the natural path of escalation is within a project using the project's own CoC process. They noted that if an issue requires escalation it should go to the CCC. If there are conflicts of interest or non-resolution, it would be escalated above the CCC. DM noted that there needs to be a defined escalation path. AB noted that it is a best practice to have such reports go to small group of defined recipients or to a single named individual, as opposed to a broad team such as the TAC.

DT noted it is important to also measure the use of escalation paths, because they may either be not needed or unusable and the end result can appear the same. The absence of a metric is not the same as the absence of the problem.

DT asked if the proposed path is to include the LF as a defined escalation path. DM confirmed. Mike Bursell (MB) noted he has questions about the familiarity of the LF with the intricacies of the CCC. He noted it may be a better cultural approach to remove individuals with a conflict vs. pushing directly to the LF.

DM noted this could be viewed as a service from the LF. AB noted there are processes that could be better documented. This would help reduce the risk of situations that go unaddressed when there isn't sufficient clarity over who receives reports and what is involved in the recusal process. AB noted that currently Mike Dolan is the escalation path for LF Projects. Brian Warner (BW) provided context on the current escalation path, noting that there are default policies that cover all projects unless the project elects to have their own process. He noted that the first and last steps are defined, but that the question is what's in the middle.

MB noted that hard-to-follow processes put people at a disadvantage. He requested clarification why CoC escalations go through the TAC vs. the governing board. DT noted that CCC attempts to follow the mantra of "Minimum Viable Governance." He noted that there is a requirement for projects to submit their CoC, but that he would welcome a PR to add an escalation process requirement.

SW asked for next steps. DM also suggested a PR adding a requirement for projects to publish an escalation path. AB recommended the escalation path be explicitly defined, and the people in the escalation path should have been trained to go through the CoC process. DT recommended also providing recommendations broadly across the CCC.

DM asked if a specific escalation process is required. AB noted there may be a need to have a specific set of individuals who are more knowledgeable of CCC dynamics who are centered in the process.

BW reviewed the process of escalation at the Linux Foundation when a report is escalated beyond a project. He noted that the LF almost always lacks specific context, and will involve the project community for context anyhow. In the interest of ensuring a functional process, he recommended the project specify its own escalation path with the Linux Foundation as fallback.

**ACTION:** Stephen Walli to work with Dan Middleton, Aeva Black, and others to develop an escalation process, to be presented to TAC and governing board.

**ACTION:** Dan Middleton to open a pull request adding a defined escalation process to project requirements.

### Process improvement suggestions

BW reviewed a number of process improvement suggestions. Dave noted that process improvements shouldn't require a TAC vote. Consensus was reached that if there are improvements that will enhance the efficiency of the TAC, that they should be made transparency. 

Jethro Beekman (JB) noted these are public meetings and everyone is welcome to attend, but there is still some distance between open meetings and recordings being broadly available to the whole internet. He noted this could create hesitance that would prevent people from participating in meetings. SW provided historical context, noting meeting recordings are the backup to the minutes. He reviewed historical concerns about posting recordings. DT noted there are two questions. Are they stored on YouTube? And are they private, unlisted, or public?

Discussion ensued. DT noted that the consensus is that YouTube is a reasonable storage location, and that the videos should be unlisted.

### Code scanning update

BW gave an update on code scanning, noting that Enarx and Open Enclave scans were completed in Fall 2021. He noted that the LF uses FOSSology, and that projects can reach out to be added to the scans.

**ACTION:** Add LFX security code scanning for projects as a topic for a future meeting.

### Updates from Outreach Committee 

BW briefly recapped updates. He noted that Ravi Sharma has been elected as chair, and Nick Vidal as co-chair. He noted that the Outreach committee is working to prioritize tasks in light of limited available program management resources.

### Common Terminology

Eric Voit (EV) reviewed the current status of the common terminology project. He noted that he and Thomas Fossati (TF) have simplified the diagram. He reviewed all changes in the diagram, noting that they are hopefully not controversial.

DT asked if the terms Confidential Computing, Confidential Computation, and Confidential Compute are synonyms. EV noted that there may be differences between the terms if memory isolation is present. He noted that MB may have further context.

MB recommended removing "Confidential Compute" as a term. "Confidential Computing" better encapsulates what CCC does. He noted that "Confidential Computation" is something that they are hoping to define.

Discussion ensued over I/O libs. Discussion ensued over the new text in the document.

### Any other business

DT noted that OE SDK will provide a project review in the next meeting, and that Henk Birkholz will provide a tech talk on TCG.

DT noted that CCC-Attestation should be on a future review, and that Enarx is ready to be scheduled. He asked MB to follow up with the project to provide a review. MB noted that NV will be able to help, and suggested March 10th.

DT reviewed the list of potential TAC tech talks. He requested that any potential speakers to volunteer for a specific date.
